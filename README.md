# redandblue skeleton
This repository is the standard starting place for new WordPress projects.

Clone it, create a new repository for your new project, and simply run `yarn` to kickstart the complicated scripts and get going. The scripts may or may not ask you intimidating questions. Answer all of them and be honest.

After the mist clears, absolutely nothing seems to have happened. It's time to kickstart Vagrant. Relevant documentation can be found at [seravo/wordpress](https://github.com/seravo/wordpress).

Assuming you've done something like this before (that means you've already configured Vagrant), running `vagrant up` should do it. Otherwise consult the documentation above.
